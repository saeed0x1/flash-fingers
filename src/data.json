  "If you can do something to get somebody excited — not everybody — but if you can be the best for somebody, then you can win.",
  "Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It's quite simple, really: Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn't at all.

  "Fall seven times and stand up eight.",
  "The successful man is the one who finds out what is the matter with his business before his competitors do.",
  "There's no shortage of remarkable ideas, what's missing is the will to execute them.",
  "Keep on going, and the chances are that you will stumble on something, perhaps when you are least expecting it. I never heard of anyone ever stumbling on something sitting down.",
  "A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.",
  "Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its whole life believing it is stupid.",
